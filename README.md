# Jambox Project

## Description :

We are designing a website and phone app for music sharing via various music platforms such as spotify, youtube, etc. This app will allow users to share their favourite songs to a social media feed where your friends can comment and like. 

It will also have music discovery features like a playlist builder where you can add friends and build a playlist together then you can share it to your feed and export it to spotify, youtube etc. it will have a trending section to show trending songs and playlists too.
